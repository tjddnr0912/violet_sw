#### 원문 내용

Thousands of people continued to travel by foot toward Gaza City on Saturday as a cease-fire held overnight, but early accounts described devastation across the area.

“The scale of destruction is really staggering,” said Olga Cherevko, a spokeswoman for the United Nations’ humanitarian office, who visited the city this past week. “We have a lot of people moving north to Gaza City and arriving to find the ruins where their homes used to be, so there is a lot of conflicted emotion.”

Mediators hope the cease-fire will lead to the end of two years of war. For many of those walking a coastal road to the north of Gaza, the pause in fighting offered a chance to return to home and to learn what remains of their lives there.

Ahmed Jabr, 37, traveling on Friday with his wife and seven children, had fled Gaza City last month and feared he might never return. “Now, I’m back,” Mr. Jabr said. “There are no bombardments, no airstrikes, no fear. I finally feel safe, and my children do, too.”
