## Key Enhancements

### 1. Visual Design Improvements

#### Score-Based Color Coding
- **4/4 points**: Dark green background (excellent signals)
- **3/4 points**: Light green background (good signals)
- **2/4 points**: Yellow/orange background (marginal signals)
- **1/4 points**: Light red background (poor signals)
- **0/4 points**: Red background (very poor signals)

#### Regime Color Coding
- **BULLISH**: Green text
- **BEARISH**: Red text
- **NEUTRAL**: Gray text

#### Profit/Loss Display
- **Profitable trades**: Dark green text with + prefix
- **Losing trades**: Crimson text
- **Events**: Royal blue text

### 2. Enhanced Column Layout

New column structure optimized for v2 data:

| Column | Content | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **ÏãúÍ∞Ñ** | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Timestamp of signal |
| **Ï†êÏàò** | 0/4 to 4/4 | Entry score with visual indicator |
| **Íµ¨ÏÑ±ÏöîÏÜå** | BB(+1), RSI(+1), Stoch(+2) | Score breakdown showing which components triggered |
| **Regime** | BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL | Market regime at signal time |
| **ÏΩîÏù∏** | BTC, ETH, etc. | Trading pair |
| **Í∞ÄÍ≤©** | Formatted price | Entry/exit price |
| **Ïú†Ìòï** | ENTRY/EXIT/EVENT | Signal type |
| **Í≤∞Í≥º** | +5.23% ($26,150) | P&L with both percentage and absolute value |

### 3. Advanced Statistics Panel

#### Row 1: Overall Metrics
- **Ï¥ù Ïã†Ìò∏**: Total entry signals count
- **ÌèâÍ∑† Ï†êÏàò**: Average entry score (X.XX/4)
- **Ï¥ù Í±∞Îûò**: Completed trades
- **Ï†ÑÏ≤¥ ÏÑ±Í≥µÎ•†**: Win rate (color-coded: green ‚â•60%, orange 40-60%, red <40%)

#### Row 2: Score Distribution
Visual display of score frequency:
```
[4/4] 12  [3/4] 25  [2/4] 18  [1/4] 8  [0/4] 3
```
Each score shows colored badge + count

#### Row 3: Regime Distribution
- **BULLISH**: Count + win rate (e.g., "15 (65% win)")
- **BEARISH**: Count + win rate
- **NEUTRAL**: Count

### 4. Powerful Filter System

Three independent filters:
1. **ÏµúÏÜå Ï†êÏàò**: Show only signals with score ‚â• X (0, 2, 3, 4)
2. **Regime**: Filter by BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL/ALL
3. **Í≤∞Í≥º**: Show only PROFIT/LOSS/PENDING/ALL

**"ÌïÑÌÑ∞ Ï¥àÍ∏∞Ìôî"** button resets all filters to defaults.

### 5. Detailed Statistics Window

Click **"üìä ÏÉÅÏÑ∏ ÌÜµÍ≥Ñ"** button to view comprehensive analysis:

#### Score Performance Analysis
For each score (0-4):
- Total signals
- Completed trades
- Win rate with W-L record
- Average profit percentage

Example output:
```
Ï†êÏàò 4/4:
  Ï¥ù Ïã†Ìò∏: 12Í∞ú
  ÏôÑÎ£å Í±∞Îûò: 10Í∞ú
  ÏäπÎ•†: 80.0% (8Ïäπ 2Ìå®)
  ÌèâÍ∑† ÏàòÏùµÎ•†: +4.23%
```

#### Regime-Based Analysis
For each regime:
- Total signals
- Win rate
- Average P&L
- Average entry score

#### Component Contribution Analysis
Shows effectiveness of each scoring component:
- **BB Lower Touch (+1)**: Occurrence rate, win rate
- **RSI Oversold (+1)**: Occurrence rate, win rate
- **Stochastic Cross (+2)**: Occurrence rate, win rate

#### Best Combination Analysis
Identifies most profitable patterns:
- **4/4 Perfect Score**: All conditions met
- **BULLISH + 3-4Ï†ê**: Optimal combination analysis

### 6. Export Capabilities

#### CSV Export
Exports to spreadsheet-compatible format with columns:
```
Timestamp, Type, Score, BB Touch, RSI Oversold, Stoch Cross,
Regime, Coin, Price, Exit Type, PnL, PnL %, Description
```
Perfect for Excel/Google Sheets analysis.

#### JSON Export
Exports with metadata:
```json
{
  "export_time": "2025-10-04T12:30:00",
  "version": "v2",
  "total_signals": 50,
  "signals": [...]
}
```

### 7. Sortable Columns (Placeholder)

Column headers are clickable for future sorting implementation.

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- **Increased max signals**: 100 ‚Üí 200 for better historical analysis
- **Dictionary-based API**: Methods now accept `Dict[str, Any]` for flexibility
- **Auto-save**: Signals automatically saved to `logs/signals_v2.json`
- **Auto-load**: Previous session loaded on startup
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing tree items during filtering

### Integration Changes

Updated `gui_app_v2.py` to pass full dictionaries instead of individual parameters:

**Before:**
```python
widget.add_entry_signal(timestamp, regime, score, components, price)
```

**After:**
```python
widget.add_entry_signal({
    'timestamp': timestamp,
    'regime': regime,
    'score': score,
    'components': components,
    'price': price,
    'coin': 'BTC'
})
```

## Usage Examples

### Test the Widget
```bash
cd /Users/seongwookjang/project/git/violet_sw/005_money/001_python_code/ver2
python test_signal_widget_v2.py
```

This generates 20 sample signals with realistic data to showcase all features.

### Integration in GUI App
The widget is automatically integrated in `gui_app_v2.py` tab 3 ("Ïã†Ìò∏ ÌûàÏä§ÌÜ†Î¶¨").

### Filter Usage
1. Select **"ÏµúÏÜå Ï†êÏàò: 3"** to see only high-quality signals
2. Select **"Regime: BULLISH"** to analyze bullish-only performance
3. Select **"Í≤∞Í≥º: PROFIT"** to study winning trades only

### Export Workflow
1. Click **"üíæ CSV ÎÇ¥Î≥¥ÎÇ¥Í∏∞"**
2. Open in Excel/Google Sheets
3. Create pivot tables for custom analysis
4. Filter by score, regime, date ranges

## Visual Comparison: V1 vs V2

### V1 Signal History
- Generic weighted signal display
- Simple columns: Time, Type, Regime, Action, Price
- Basic statistics
- No score breakdown
- No filtering

### V2 Signal History (Enhanced)
- **Score-based color coding** (0-4 visual indicators)

- **Advanced statistics**: Score distribution, regime analysis, component effectiveness
- **Powerful filtering**: By score, regime, result
- **Detailed stats window**: Win rate by score, optimal combinations
- **CSV/JSON export**: For external analysis
- **Regime-aware insights**: Bullish vs bearish performance comparison

---

## Design Philosophy

1. **Information Density**: Show more data without overwhelming the user
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use color to communicate signal quality instantly
3. **Actionable Insights**: Help traders understand which signal combinations work best
4. **Data Export**: Enable external analysis in spreadsheets or custom tools
5. **Professional Aesthetics**: Modern, clean design with proper spacing and typography

## Summary

The enhanced v2 signal history widget transforms signal tracking from simple logging into a powerful analysis tool. By clearly displaying the 0-4 point scoring system with color coding and providing comprehensive statistics, traders can:

1. **Quickly identify high-quality signals** (3-4 points)
2. **Understand which components contribute to success** (BB, RSI, Stoch)
3. **Analyze regime-specific performance** (Bullish vs Bearish)
4. **Export data for deeper analysis** (CSV/JSON)
5. **Make data-driven decisions** about which signals to trust

This redesign makes the v2 signal history widget visually distinct from v1 while providing actionable insights that help traders optimize their strategy.
