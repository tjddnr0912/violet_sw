## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test (Standalone)
```bash
cd /Users/seongwookjang/project/git/violet_sw/005_money/001_python_code/ver2
python test_signal_widget_v2.py
```

This will:
1. Open a window with the enhanced widget
2. Generate 20 sample signals with realistic data
3. Show various scores (0-4) and regimes
4. Demonstrate color coding and statistics

### Full Integration Test (with GUI)
```bash
cd /Users/seongwookjang/project/git/violet_sw/005_money/001_python_code/ver2
python run_gui_v2.py
```

Then:
1. Start the bot
2. Navigate to "신호 히스토리" tab
3. Wait for signals to appear
4. Test filters
5. Click "상세 통계" button
6. Try CSV/JSON export

---

## 📊 Features to Demonstrate

### 1. Score Color Coding
- Look for green-highlighted rows (3-4 scores)
- Yellow/orange rows (2 scores)
- Red rows (0-1 scores)

### 2. Statistics Panel
- Check score distribution badges
- Observe regime counts with win rates
- Notice color-coded success rate

### 3. Filtering
```
Test sequence:
1. Set minimum score to 3 → see only high-quality signals
2. Set regime to BULLISH → see regime filtering
3. Set result to PROFIT → see only winning trades
4. Click "필터 초기화" → return to all signals
```

### 4. Detailed Statistics
```
Click "📊 상세 통계" button to see:
- Win rate for each score (0-4)
- Regime performance comparison
- Component contribution (which indicators work best)
- Optimal combinations (4/4 scores, BULLISH+high score)
```

### 5. Export
```
Test sequence:
1. Click "💾 CSV 내보내기"
2. Save file
3. Open in Excel/Google Sheets
4. Verify all columns present
5. Create pivot table by score/regime
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The enhanced v2 signal history widget is successful if:

1. ✅ **Visual Distinction**: Clearly different from v1 with color coding
2. ✅ **Score Visibility**: 0-4 scoring system prominently displayed
3. ✅ **Component Breakdown**: Shows which indicators triggered (BB, RSI, Stoch)
4. ✅ **Actionable Insights**: Statistics help identify best signal patterns
5. ✅ **Professional Design**: Clean, modern, well-organized layout
6. ✅ **Filtering Power**: Easy to isolate high-quality signals
7. ✅ **Export Capability**: Data accessible for external analysis
8. ✅ **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing v2 GUI

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Column Sorting**: Clicking column headers shows placeholder message (future enhancement)
2. **Filter Performance**: With 200+ signals, filtering may have slight delay
3. **Statistics Window**: Text-based display (future: add charts/graphs)
4. **Export Format**: CSV uses basic format (future: add formatted Excel with formulas)

---

## 💡 Future Enhancement Ideas
