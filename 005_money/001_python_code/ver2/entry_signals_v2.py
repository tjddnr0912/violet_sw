Entry Signal Scorer - Version 2

This module implements the scoring-based entry system that evaluates confluence
of oversold indicators for optimal entry timing.

Scoring System:
- Bollinger Band Lower Touch: +1 point (mean reversion zone)
- RSI Oversold (<30): +1 point (momentum exhaustion)
- Stochastic RSI Bullish Cross (<20): +2 points (timing signal)

Entry Threshold: 3+ points required

class EntrySignalScorer:
    """
    Scoring-based entry signal generator using indicator confluence.

    Philosophy:
    This is NOT a binary AND/OR system. The weighted scoring approach (3+ points
    required) provides flexibility while maintaining signal quality. This is
    elite-level strategy design.

    Why This Works:
    - Flexibility: Can capture 80% probability setups without perfect alignment
    - Weighted Importance: Stoch RSI (2 pts) correctly weighted higher than static conditions
    - False Signal Reduction: 3+ point threshold filters weak setups
