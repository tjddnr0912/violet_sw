# Holdings P&L Percentage Fix - Ver3 GUI

## Problem Summary

The Holdings section in the Ver3 GUI Account Information widget was displaying **0%** profit/loss for all positions, even when coins were showing gains or losses.

**Symptom**: Green percentages in Holdings section always showing "0%" instead of actual profit/loss calculations like "+15.3%" or "-8.2%".

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `/Users/seongwookjang/project/git/violet_sw/005_money/001_python_code/ver3/gui_app_v3.py`:

### Original Problem (LIVE Mode)

In LIVE mode (lines 742-802), the `_update_account_info()` method:

1. Queried Bithumb API for actual coin balances
2. Called `_get_avg_price_from_positions(coin, current_price)` to get average purchase price
3. **BUG**: This method tried to read from `logs/positions_v3.json` file
4. **BUG**: When the file didn't exist or coin wasn't in file, it returned `current_price` as fallback (line 856)
5. **Result**: `avg_price = current_price`, causing P&L calculation to be `((current_price - current_price) / current_price) * 100 = 0%`

### Why This Happened

- The `positions_v3.json` file is only created/updated when the bot executes actual trades via `LiveExecutorV3`
- If the bot hasn't run yet, or positions were cleared, the file might not exist
- The fallback logic was incorrect - using `current_price` as `avg_price` always results in 0% P&L

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Use Portfolio Summary Data (Primary Fix)

**File**: `001_python_code/ver3/gui_app_v3.py`
**Method**: `_update_account_info()` (lines 742-813)

Changed LIVE mode logic to prioritize portfolio summary data:

```python
# NEW LOGIC (lines 776-788):
# Try to get avg_price from portfolio summary first
avg_price = current_price  # Default fallback
if coin in coins_data:
    position = coins_data[coin].get('position', {})
    if position.get('has_position', False):
        # Use entry_price from portfolio summary
        avg_price = position.get('entry_price', current_price)
    else:
        # No position in summary, try positions file
        avg_price = self._get_avg_price_from_positions(coin, current_price)
else:
    # Coin not in summary, try positions file
    avg_price = self._get_avg_price_from_positions(coin, current_price)
```

**Why this works**:
- The portfolio summary (`summary.get('coins', {})`) is updated in real-time by the bot
- It contains accurate `entry_price` for all active positions
- Falls back to file-based lookup only if position not in summary
- Matches the DRY-RUN mode logic (which was already correct)

### Fix 2: Widget Display Bug Fix

**File**: `001_python_code/ver3/widgets/account_info_widget.py`
**Method**: `_update_holdings_display()` (line 200)

Fixed a bug in the holdings widget cleanup logic:

```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
self.holding_widgets[coin].destroy()

# NEW (FIXED):
self.holding_widgets[coin]['frame'].destroy()
```

**Why this was needed**:
- `self.holding_widgets[coin]` is a dictionary: `{'frame': ..., 'pnl_label': ..., 'avg_label': ..., etc}`
- Calling `.destroy()` on a dict caused `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'destroy'`
- This prevented switching between different coins in the holdings display

## Testing Performed

### Test Script: `test_account_widget_pnl.py`

Created comprehensive test that validates:

1. **Profit Scenario**: BTC bought at 80M KRW, now at 90M KRW → **+12.50%** ✅
2. **Loss Scenario**: ETH bought at 3.5M KRW, now at 3M KRW → **-14.29%** ✅
3. **Multiple Coins**: BTC +5%, ETH -8%, XRP +15% → **All correct** ✅

**Test Output**:
```
[DEBUG] BTC Holdings Update:
  avg_price: 80,000,000 KRW
  current_price: 90,000,000 KRW
  quantity: 0.01000000
  pnl_pct: 12.50%  ← CORRECT!
```

## Files Modified

1. **`001_python_code/ver3/gui_app_v3.py`**
   - Fixed `_update_account_info()` method to use portfolio summary data
   - Lines 764-794: Added portfolio summary lookup before file fallback

2. **`001_python_code/ver3/widgets/account_info_widget.py`**
   - Fixed `_update_holdings_display()` widget cleanup bug
   - Line 200: Changed `self.holding_widgets[coin].destroy()` to `self.holding_widgets[coin]['frame'].destroy()`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### DRY-RUN Mode
- Holdings display shows correct P&L percentages based on simulated positions
- Example: If bot entered BTC at 85M and price is now 90M, shows **+5.88%**

### LIVE Mode
- Holdings display shows correct P&L percentages based on actual entry prices from portfolio summary
- Falls back to positions file only if position not in active summary
- If no position data available anywhere, still defaults to 0% (prevents crash)

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Start the Ver3 GUI in DRY-RUN mode**:
   ```bash
   cd 001_python_code/ver3
   python gui_app_v3.py
   ```

2. **Start the bot** and let it enter a position

3. **Check Account Information widget**:
   - Holdings section should show coin name (e.g., "BTC")
   - Green or red percentage should show actual P&L (e.g., "+12.50%" or "-8.20%")
   - NOT showing "0%" for active positions

4. **Watch for price changes**:
   - As market price changes, the percentage should update every 5 seconds
   - Positive gains → Green "+X.XX%"
   - Losses → Red "-X.XX%"

- **Portfolio Summary Source**: `001_python_code/ver3/portfolio_manager_v3.py` → `get_portfolio_summary()`
- **Position Tracking**: `001_python_code/ver3/live_executor_v3.py` → Creates `positions_v3.json`
- **GUI Bot Wrapper**: `001_python_code/ver3/gui_trading_bot_v3.py` → Bridges bot and GUI

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Holdings (LIVE mode only)**: If you manually transfer coins into your Bithumb account (not via bot), the GUI has no entry price data and will show 0% P&L until you manually add position data to `positions_v3.json`.

2. **File-Based Fallback**: The fallback to `positions_v3.json` is still present for edge cases, but may return 0% if file doesn't exist.

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements:

1. **Manual Entry Price Input**: Add GUI feature to manually set entry price for holdings not tracked by bot
2. **Transaction History Integration**: Calculate average price from transaction history if position file missing
3. **Warning Indicator**: Show a ⚠️ icon when P&L is 0% due to missing entry price data
