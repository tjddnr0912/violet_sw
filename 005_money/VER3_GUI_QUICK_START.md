## Understanding the Bot's Behavior

### Analysis Cycle (Every 15 Minutes)

1. **Parallel Analysis:**
   - All selected coins analyzed simultaneously
   - Each coin gets entry score (0-4) and market regime

2. **Portfolio Decision:**
   - Count current positions
   - If positions < 2, consider entry signals
   - Prioritize by score (highest first)
   - If score tied, use coin rank (BTC > ETH > XRP > SOL)

3. **Execution:**
   - Enter position if score high enough (‚â•3)
   - Exit position if exit signal triggered
   - Log all decisions and results

### Entry Scoring (Per Coin)

**Ver2 Strategy Applied:**
- Daily EMA regime filter (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- 4H score-based entry (0-4 points):
  - +1: BB lower band touch
  - +1: RSI oversold (< 30)
  - +2: Stochastic cross below 20
- Only enters on bullish regime + score ‚â• 3

### Portfolio Limits

- **Max Positions:** 2 (portfolio-wide)
- **Max Per Coin:** 1 (can't double-up on same coin)
- **Entry Priority:** Highest score first
- **Risk Limit:** 6% total portfolio risk

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start with Dry-Run
Always test new strategies in dry-run mode first:
- Check **"üîí Dry-run Mode"** before starting
- Run for a few days to verify behavior
- Review logs and decisions

### 2. Choose Liquid Coins
Default selection (BTC, ETH, XRP) recommended:
- High liquidity (easy to enter/exit)
- Lower slippage
- Better price discovery

### 3. Monitor Regularly
Check GUI periodically:
- Watch entry scores fluctuate
- Verify positions opening/closing as expected
- Review P&L in real-time

### 4. Understand Limitations
- Coin changes require bot restart
- Max 2 positions at any time
- 15-minute analysis interval (not real-time tick data)

### 5. Risk Management
Ver3 has built-in safeguards:
- 6% max portfolio risk
- Stop-loss on every position
- Consecutive loss limits
- Daily loss caps

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Launch

**Error: "backtrader not found"**
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd 005_money
source .venv/bin/activate  # if using venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Error: "Ver3 module not found"**
```bash
# Verify you're in correct directory
pwd  # Should end with /005_money
ls 001_python_code/ver3/  # Should show ver3 files
```

### Bot Won't Start

**Check:**
1. Is dry-run mode enabled? (Safer for testing)
2. Are dependencies installed?
3. Check logs tab for error messages

### No Trades Executing

**Possible reasons:**
1. Entry scores too low (need ‚â•3)
2. Market regime not bullish
3. Portfolio limit reached (2 positions)
4. Dry-run mode enabled (no real trades)

### Coin Selection Not Applying

**Remember:**
1. Bot must be stopped first
2. Click "Apply Changes" after selecting
3. Restart bot to use new coins
4. Preferences saved automatically
