## Reading the Indicators

### LED Color Meanings
```
🔴 Red (Blinking)   = BUY SIGNAL
   → Price likely to go UP
   → Consider entering LONG

🔵 Blue (Blinking)  = SELL SIGNAL
   → Price likely to go DOWN
   → Consider closing LONG or entering SHORT

⚪ Gray              = NEUTRAL / HOLD
   → No clear direction
   → Wait for better setup
```

### Indicator Interpretations

**MA (Moving Average)**
- Positive difference → Uptrend
- Negative difference → Downtrend
- Value shows trend strength

**MACD**
- Positive histogram → Bullish momentum
- Negative histogram → Bearish momentum
- Larger values → Stronger momentum

**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
- < 30 → Oversold (potential buy)
- > 70 → Overbought (potential sell)
- 40-60 → Neutral zone

**Stochastic**
- K > D & < 20 → Strong buy signal
- K < D & > 80 → Strong sell signal
- Confirmation indicator for RSI

**Bollinger Bands**
- Position < 20% → Near lower band (buy zone)
- Position > 80% → Near upper band (sell zone)
- Position ~50% → Middle of range

**ATR (Average True Range)**
- Higher % → More volatile (wider stops)
- Lower % → Less volatile (tighter stops)
- Use for position sizing

**Volume**
- > 1.5x → High volume (signal confirmation)
- < 0.5x → Low volume (weak signal)
- Higher is better for reliability

**ADX (Trend Strength)**
- > 25 → Strong trend (use trend-following)
- < 15 → Weak trend / ranging (use mean-reversion)
- 15-25 → Transitional period

## Risk Management Guide

### Reading the Risk Panel

```
진입가: 165,245,000원
  ↓ Your entry price (current market price)

손절가: 164,141,857원 (-0.67%)
  ↓ Stop loss (exit if price drops here)
  ↓ Prevents large losses

익절1: 166,623,929원 (+0.83%)
  ↓ First target (close 50% of position)
  ↓ Lock in partial profits

익절2: 167,451,286원 (+1.34%)
  ↓ Second target (close remaining 50%)
  ↓ Maximize winning trades

R:R 비율: TP1: 1:1.25, TP2: 1:2.00
  ↓ Risk:Reward ratios
  ↓ Should be > 1:1 (reward > risk)
```

### Position Sizing Example

**Account Balance**: 1,000,000원
**Risk per Trade**: 1% = 10,000원
**Entry**: 165,245,000원
**Stop Loss**: 164,141,857원 (-0.67%)

**Calculation**:
```
Risk per coin = 165,245,000 - 164,141,857 = 1,103,143원
Position size = 10,000 / 1,103,143 = 0.00906 coins

Investment = 0.00906 × 165,245,000 = 1,497,120원
(but only risking 10,000원 = 1% of account)
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts & Tips

### Productivity Tips
1. **Tab Navigation**: Use tabs to organize information
   - 거래 현황: Overview
   - 📊 실시간 차트: Visual analysis
   - 📋 신호 히스토리: Past signals
   - 거래 내역: Transaction log

2. **Quick Glance**: Focus on 3 key areas
   - LED panel: Individual signals

   - 리스크 관리: Entry/exit levels

3. **Regular Checks**:
   - Every 5 minutes: Quick LED scan
   - Every 15 minutes: Full panel review
   - Every hour: Strategy effectiveness review

### Advanced Tips
1. **Correlation Check**: Look for indicator agreement
   - Strong signal = 6+ indicators agree
   - Weak signal = Mixed/conflicting indicators

2. **Divergence Warning**: If price makes new high but indicators don't
   - Potential reversal signal
   - Consider taking profits

3. **Volume Confirmation**: Always check volume
   - Strong signal + high volume = More reliable
   - Strong signal + low volume = Less reliable

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Issues

**Problem**: Window doesn't open
```bash
# Check dependencies
pip list | grep tkinter

# Reinstall if needed
pip install --upgrade tk
```

```

**Problem**: Missing good opportunities
```
Solution:
1. Decrease confidence threshold (0.6 → 0.5)
